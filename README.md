# Backlog

- Unit tests
- Write README.md
- Review how to fetch paths mock function
- Deploy to GitHub pages?

- Considerations for production-ready React projects:
  - Code quality and maintainability (e.g., refactoring, type safety, error handling, documentation, testing, version control)
  - Performance and optimization (e.g., state management, lazy loading, memoization, caching)
  - User experience (e.g., accessibility, responsiveness, browser compatibility, feedback on every interaction)
  - Additional considerations (e.g., monitoring and logging, backups, user feedback loop, SEO, data sanitization, avoid malicious or vulnerable dependencies, authentication and authorization)
