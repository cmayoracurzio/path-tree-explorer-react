# Path Tree Explorer React component

The following project implements a Path Tree Explorer component using React, TypeScript, Vite, and `styled-components`. It also takes into account some best practices for production-ready React components.

## Considerations for production-ready React components (summarized)

- Code quality and maintainability (e.g., refactoring, type safety, error handling, documentation, unit testing, version control)
- Performance and optimization (e.g., avoid excessive re-rendering and unnecessary re-calculations using lazy loading, memoizing calculations, caching API calls)
- User experience (e.g., accessibility, responsiveness, browser compatibility, feedback on user interaction)
- Other (e.g., monitoring and logging, backups, user feedback loop, SEO, data sanitization, minimizing vulnerable dependencies, authentication and authorization)
